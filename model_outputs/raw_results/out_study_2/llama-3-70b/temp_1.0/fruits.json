Apples are native to Central Asia and Europe, figs are native to the Middle East and Mediterranean region, and oranges are native to Southeast Asia but are often grown in warm temperate regions.\n\nNote that these categories are not absolute and some of these fruits may be grown in other regions through cultivation or trade. However, this grouping reflects their native origins and general climate associations."
