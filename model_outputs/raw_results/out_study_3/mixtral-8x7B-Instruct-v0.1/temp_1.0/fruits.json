However, you could invent your own mnemonic that helps you remember that these are all types of fruit. For example, you could imagine making a fruit salad with all of these ingredients, or you could try to come up with a sentence that starts with each word. It's up to you! The important thing is to find a way to remember that all of these words are related to fruit."
