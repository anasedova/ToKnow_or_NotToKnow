They are known for their agility, sharp teeth and claws, and predatory behavior.\n2. Fox and Greyhound: These are both types of mammals, but they belong to different families. A fox is a member of the Canidae family, which also includes dogs, wolves, and coyotes. They are known for their intelligence, agility, and cunningness. A greyhound is a member of the Canidae family too, but it is a breed of domesticated dog that is known for its speed and athleticism.\n3. Dove and Penguin: These are both types of birds, but they belong to different orders. A dove is a member of the Columbiformes order, which includes pigeons and doves. They are known for their gentle nature, round bodies, and cooing sounds. A penguin is a member of the Sphenisciformes order, which includes flightless birds. They are known for their black and white plumage, waddling walk, and adaptability to water.\n\nSo, in summary, Jaguar, Lynx, and Puma belong to the same family of big cats, while Fox and Greyhound belong to the same family of mammals, and Dove and Penguin belong to different orders of birds."

However, they are not as fast as some other big cats, such as cheetahs, who can reach speeds of up to 75 miles per hour (120 kilometers per hour).\n\nJaguars are found in the forests and grasslands of Central and South America, and they are considered to be near threatened due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting and poaching.
