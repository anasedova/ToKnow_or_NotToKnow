Specifically, they are all common names for different species of animals.\n\nGreyhound is a breed of dog known for its racing abilities and slender build. Dove is a group of birds that are known for their soft feathers and are often used as symbols of peace. Puma, also known as a mountain lion or cougar, is a large cat native to the Americas. Penguins are a group of flightless aquatic birds, characterized by their tuxedo-like black and white feathers. Jaguar is a large cat species native to Central and South America. Lynx is a genus of medium-sized wild cats with distinctive tufts of black hair on the tips of their ears. Fox is a small to medium-sized omnivore with a pointed snout and bushy tail.\n\nTherefore, they all share the common characteristic of being animals, specifically, they are all animals that are frequently recognized by common names."
