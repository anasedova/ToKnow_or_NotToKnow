Mangoes and papayas are commonly found in South Asia and Central America, while kiwis are native to China and Southeast Asia.\n\n**Category 2: Temperate Fruits**\n\n* Apple\n* Fig\n* Orange\n\nThese fruits are native to temperate regions and are often associated with cooler climates. Apples are commonly found in North America and Europe, figs are native to the Mediterranean region, and oranges are widely cultivated in the United States and other temperate regions.\n\nNote that these categories are not rigid and some fruits may overlap between them. For example, kiwis are now widely cultivated in temperate regions like New Zealand, and oranges are grown in some tropical regions. However, based on their origin and primary cultivation regions, the above grouping provides a reasonable categorization."
