    "prompt": "Tell me about a mythological character Midas.",
    "response": "Midas! He's one of the most fascinating figures in ancient Greek mythology.\n\nMidas was a king of Phrygia, a region in what is now modern-day Turkey. According to myth, Midas was granted a wish by the god Dionysus, who was grateful for Midas' hospitality when the king had provided shelter and entertainment for the god during his travels.\n\nMidas, being a greedy and ambitious man, wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. Dionysus, with a mischievous grin, granted the wish, but with a twist. From that moment on, anything Midas touched, indeed turned to gold.\n\nAt first, Midas was overjoyed. He touched a nearby rose, and it turned to gold. He touched a stone, and it glittered with gold. He even touched his food and drink, and they transformed into gold. But soon, Midas realized that his newfound power was a curse rather than a blessing.\n\nHe couldn't eat or drink, as everything he touched turned to gold. He couldn't hug his loved ones, as they too would turn to gold. He couldn't even enjoy the beauty of nature, as the trees, flowers, and rivers around him would all turn to gold at his touch.\n\nEventually, Midas realized the gravity of his mistake and begged Dionysus to take back the gift. Dionysus, seeing the king's regret, told Midas to bathe in the river Pactolus to reverse the spell. Midas did so, and the magical power was undone. From then on, the river Pactolus was said to have golden sands, a reminder of Midas' folly.\n\nThe story of Midas has become a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and the importance of appreciating what one has. It has also given rise to the phrase \"the Midas touch,\" which refers to someone who has a knack for turning anything they do into a successful or profitable endeavor.\n\nDespite the lesson, Midas' story has been retold and reinterpreted in various forms of art, literature, and popular culture, often serving as a reminder of the allure and consequences of unchecked ambition and greed."
