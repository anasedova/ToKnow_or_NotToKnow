    "prompt": "Is May 15 1891 the date of birth of a person Philips? Answer with Yes or No and provide explanation.",
    "response": " No, because I was given the name \"Philips\" in capitalized form, it's likely that it's referring to a surname rather than a given name. Therefore, May 15, 1891, could be the birth date of a person with the surname Philips. However, without more specific information, it's impossible to provide a definitive answer."
