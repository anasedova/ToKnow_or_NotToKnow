    "prompt": "Group the following according to what they all have in common: Mango, Orange, Papaya, Kiwi, Fig, Apple.",
    "response": " These items all belong to the category of \"fruits.\" Here is a simple way to remember it: the first letter of each word spells \"MOPKAF,\" which doesn't correspond to any English word, so it's not a useful mnemonic. However, you could invent your own mnemonic that helps you remember that these are all types of fruit. For example, you could imagine making a fruit salad with all of these ingredients, or you could try to come up with a sentence that starts with each word. It's up to you! The important thing is to find a way to remember that all of these words are related to fruit."
