It is often influenced by personal values, cultural norms, and situational factors.\n\n4. **Degrees and Spectrum**: Fidelity is not a binary concept; it exists on a spectrum. One can demonstrate varying levels of fidelity, which adds to its complexity and abstractness.\n\nDue to these reasons, fidelity is considered a high-level abstract concept, encompassing a range of meanings and applications that are not easily quantified or universally defined."}]
