He was born on February 26, 1829, in Buttenheim, Kingdom of Bavaria (now part of Germany), to a Jewish family. Strauss immigrated to the United States in 1847, settling in San Francisco, California, during the California Gold Rush.\n\nInitially, Strauss worked as a dry goods peddler, selling clothing, fabric, and other supplies to miners and settlers. In 1850, he opened a dry goods business in San Francisco, which became successful due to the high demand for clothing and supplies during the gold rush era. He named his business \"Levi Strauss & Co.\"\n\nIn the 1850s, Strauss began to focus on work clothing, recognizing the need for durable and practical garments for working-class people. He started manufacturing work pants made from a sturdy cotton fabric called \"serge de N\u00eemes,\" which was later shortened to \"denim.\" The pants were designed to be rugged, comfortable, and affordable, with copper rivets at the pockets to strengthen them.\n\nIn 1872, Strauss and his brothers, Jonas and Louis, received a patent for \"Improvement in Fastening Pocket-Openings,\" which introduced the use of copper rivets to reinforce the pockets of work pants. This innovation led to the creation of the iconic Levi's 501 style jeans, which remain a staple of the company's product line to this day.\n\nLevi Strauss & Co. continued to grow and expand, and by the late 19th century, the company had become a leading manufacturer of work clothing in the United States. Strauss was a pioneer in the industry, and his commitment to quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction helped establish his company as a household name.\n\nStrauss was also a philanthropist and a generous supporter of his community. He was a member of the San Francisco Board of Education and contributed to various charitable causes, including the establishment of a synagogue and a hospital in San Francisco.\n\nLevi Strauss died on September 26, 1902, at the age of 73.
